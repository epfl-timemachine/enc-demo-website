Eleven haloed apostles stand in two symmetrical groups behind him, each in red or green tunics with varied hair and beard styles. A kneeling layman in a red cloak under the table tilts his head back, catching drops from the bowl, representing the reception of Christ’s blood in Communion. The richly patterned white tablecloth is strewn with stylized chalices, pitchers, knives, and plates painted in gold and black. The canopy features pointed arches, blue tile motifs, and gold finials, while the deep ultramarine background is dotted with gold stars. Figures are rendered frontal with minimal naturalistic space; scale reflects theological hierarchy, Christ being largest. Draperies display crisp folds with white highlights; halos are executed in raised gesso and burnished gold leaf. The layman’s simple tunic and bare feet contrast with the apostles’ richly colored robes and status. The overall arrangement emphasizes central sacramental action and devotional focus."

    "scholarly_interpretation": "This full-page illumination, likely produced in a mid-14th-century Parisian workshop, exemplifies the Gothic tradition’s fusion of architectural framing and theological program. The use of an ornate trefoil canopy and burnished gold leaf for halos and star-diaper background links the manuscript to the major illuminator ateliers serving high-status patrons. The iconography—Christ presenting his severed head in a bowl to the kneeling layman—reflects a sophisticated Eucharistic allegory that would have reinforced belief in the real presence during private devotions. Stylistically, the crisp quill-pen outlines and flat color fields, combined with restrained white-lead highlights, signal a mature technique that balances clarity with sumptuous decoration. Minimal perspectival ambition underscores hierarchical scaling: Christ’s dominance conveys theological priority, while the subordinate layman visually represents the faithful viewer. Comparatively, this scene shares affinities with Parisian Books of Hours in its star-spangled heavens and Gothic micro-architecture but innovates through its visceral depiction of the host as Christ’s head, perhaps intended to heighten devotional emotion. The illumination thus negotiates tradition and innovation, serving both pedagogical and aesthetic functions. It offers significant insight into lay piety’s visual culture and the technical prowess of 14th-century luxury manuscript production."
