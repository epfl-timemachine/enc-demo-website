Behind Christ stand four figures: two directly in front wear red and blue garments, one bearded figure in a pointed hat gestures toward Christ, and two background disciples cluster in blue and red cloaks. Each figure is rendered with slender elongated bodies, full sleeves, and subtly indicated folds. Faces have small curved noses, almond eyes, and short curly hair or simple tonsure. The spatial layout is shallow, indicated by overlapping feet and garments, with no defined horizon. Costumes include mantles fastened at the shoulder, tunics with simple hems, and exposed bare feet. The kneeling disciple clutches hands in prayer, while others raise open palms. The scene lacks architectural framing, relying on compositional groupings and gestures to convey narrative significance."

    "scholarly_interpretation": "Created in the later thirteenth century within a northern French workshop, this folio represents a didactic sequence of Resurrection appearances, integrating text and image in a grid format that reflects pedagogical priorities of the period. The simplified architectural tomb scene and the distinct undulating ground line are characteristic of the Parisian style, while the restrained palette of green, red, and blue suggests a shift toward economical yet expressive illumination practices. The uniform application of iron gall ink outlines with white lead highlights indicates a technical sophistication consistent with professional ateliers serving educational institutions. Iconographically, the repeated halo motifs and gestural continuity reinforce typological connections between Christ’s various manifestations, underscoring the theological emphasis on recognition and revelation. The presence of Latin captions in red rubric and blue script directly within each compartment illustrates the interplay between visual and verbal exegesis, guiding viewers through the narrative. Unlike more lavish liturgical manuscripts, this folio eschews gold leaf in favor of clarity and legibility, aligning with the needs of university scholars. Comparatively, it shares compositional strategies with the Bible Historiale of Guyart des Moulins, yet its economical palette and grid organization point to an innovative synthesis of traditional iconography and emerging scholastic priorities within thirteenth-century Parisian illumination."
