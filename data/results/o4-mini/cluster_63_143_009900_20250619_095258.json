To his right stands an executioner clad in unornamented brown-outlined robe, holding a sword aloft. Two martyrs kneel in green and yellow tunics, bodies leaning forward as red spurts mark decapitation; their severed heads lie just beyond their feet. In the lower register, the same judge now wears a dark green mantle; he observes from left, seated. The executioner stands behind two newly beheaded martyrs within a rounded masonry arch. The victims’ bodies drape forward over the niche threshold, their heads removed but not depicted on the ground. Both scenes employ flat color fields, brown ink outlines, and minimal spatial recession. Clothing details include long tunics with simple folds indicated by line work, and mantles secured with small shoulder clasps. The judge’s crown and bench, the executioner’s sword, and the architectural niche serve as status and setting markers. Depth is suggested only by slight overlap of figures; the compositional focus remains on the act of martyrdom and its ritual display."

    "scholarly_interpretation": "The two-register miniature belongs to a 13th-century hagiographic codex, likely produced in a monastic workshop committed to narrating martyrs’ Passion episodes. The restrained palette and flat application of pigments suggest an economical yet precise style, while the consistent use of verdigris green and minium red underscores thematic focus on earthly life and the blood of sacrifice. The Gothic textualis script and formal layout indicate a high-quality production intended for monastic use rather than lay display. The sequential grid of scenes reflects an educational function: top register captures the judicial sentence and execution, bottom register memorializes the martyrs’ bodies in a temple-like niche, reinforcing the theological linkage between trial and sacred rest. The lack of perspectival depth and the emphasis on hierarchical scaling align with contemporary conventions in northern French illumination, where narrative clarity outweighs spatial illusion. Iconographically, the crowned judge asserts secular authority confronted by divine witness in the form of martyrdom, while the blood spurts become almost ornamental devices drawing visual attention. Comparison with other Passionary manuscripts shows a similar economization of color and line, yet this example’s subtle architectural detailing suggests influence from emerging Parisian workshops. Overall, the miniature balances traditional iconography with a simplified compositional approach tailored to a monastic teaching context."
