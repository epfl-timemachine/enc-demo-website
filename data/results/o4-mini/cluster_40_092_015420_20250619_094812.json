The left figure (Aaron) stands holding a long staff vertically, clad in a full-length tunic with geometric patterned borders and a mantle draped over one shoulder. To his right Moses sits on a cushioned throne beneath a scalloped canopy, wearing a crown-like headpiece, flowing robes with visible weave pattern, and sandals; his right hand is extended in gesture. The throne rests on a low plinth decorated with interlace. Flanking the arch are two square turrets with crenellations. Lower scene: At right Moses strides barefoot, holding his rod in his right hand and gesturing with his left toward stylized wavy lines of parted water. He wears a long, full-sleeved robe with diagonal fold lines. To his left a single camel-like beast carries one veiled rider; behind them at least eleven Israelite figures follow on foot, each in tunic and mantle, some with pointed hats or headwraps, their hands raised or folded in supplication. Figures overlap in a dense procession, standing on a simple ground line marked with grass tufts."

    "scholarly_interpretation": "This bifoliate arrangement of Exodus episodes reflects a thirteenth-century monastic workshop practice aimed at instructing novices through clear, didactic imagery. The top register’s static enthronement of Moses and Aaron under an elaborate scalloped canopy evokes the twin offices of prophet and priest, emphasizing divine authority through architectural framing and regal posture. The lower register’s kinetic scene of the Red Sea crossing employs dense overlapping to convey collective movement and divine intervention. The monochrome line technique, likely preparatory drawing for a full-color illumination, demonstrates the workshop’s disciplined execution of contour and pattern, with uniform quill strokes ensuring legibility. Iconographically, the repeated vertical staff motif unites both episodes, underlining the rod as symbol of divine power. Stylistically, the flat, hierarchical scaling and absence of pictorial depth place the emphasis on narrative clarity rather than illusionistic space, typical of early Gothic manuscript illumination influenced by teaching Bibles in northern France. Compared with contemporaneous Old Testament cycles, this sequence is notable for its economy of ornament—no colored pigments are recorded here—suggesting it may have served as a modello for fully painted miniatures. Its compositional cohesion and precision underscore the didactic aims of monastic scriptoria, reinforcing theological teachings through visual continuity and sequential reading."
