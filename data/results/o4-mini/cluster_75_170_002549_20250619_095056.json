Christ’s body is central, head bowed, torso supported by Joseph of Arimathea (wearing a crown) at right and aided by Nicodemus raising Christ’s right arm. To the left, the Virgin Mary stands, draped in red and blue, supporting Christ’s left hand. Below her stands a haloed youth, St John the Evangelist, identifiable by his pilgrim’s staff. At the foot of the cross, Mary Magdalene kneels, in green and red robes, lifting Christ’s feet with tender gesture. A ladder rests against the cross, and a hammer lies on a small bench at lower left, signifying the nails just removed. At the base, a skull and crossbones on a rocky mound denote Golgotha and Adam’s burial place. The figures are arranged in a shallow space, overlapping to suggest depth; Christ is largest, subordinate figures slightly smaller. Drapery shows fine brushwork and stippling in highlights. Costumes: Mary’s cloak edged in white lining; Joseph’s mantle of purple trimmed in gold; Magdalene’s green tunic with vermilion cloak folded in angular pleats. The composition centers on Christ’s descent, supported by symmetrical grouping of mourners, with the interlace border reinforcing visual focus."

    "scholarly_interpretation": "This leaf, likely produced in a mid-13th-century Parisian workshop, reflects the high Gothic illumination tradition associated with private Books of Hours. The lavish burnished gold background and refined palette of azurite, vermilion and verdigris correspond to luxury manuscripts commissioned by wealthy lay patrons seeking intimate devotional images. The centralized composition, with Christ at the exact visual center and a symmetrical grouping of mourners, adheres to established iconographic conventions while the finely wrought interlace border suggests influences from earlier Insular motifs adapted into continental frame design. Technical analysis reveals a confident underdrawing and layered application of pigments with white highlights, pointing to a professional atelier employing specialist gilders and painters. Iconographically, the depiction of the Descent from the Cross underscores the theological emphasis on Christ’s human suffering and redemptive act, reinforced by the symbolic skull of Adam at the foot of the cross, linking Old Testament typology to New Testament fulfillment. Comparatively, the figural style—elongated proportions, softly modeled faces and accentuated drapery folds—shares affinities with the so-called Master of the Paris Ossuaries. This miniature balances tradition with a subtle innovation in spatial arrangement, using overlapping figures for depth rather than strict hierarchical tiers. The manuscript thus exemplifies the convergence of personal piety, artistic sophistication and courtly taste in the Gothic era’s devotional culture."
