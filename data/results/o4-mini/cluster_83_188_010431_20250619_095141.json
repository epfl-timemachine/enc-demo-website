Both are outlined in fine brown ink; feathers are modeled with white highlights against burnished gold. The plinth is colored with layered azurite and verdigris, edged by a thin pink fillet. The circular frame is composed of alternating blue and red square motifs on a white ground, all set against a gilded background. Lower medallion: A pelican stands atop a similar green mound, her breast pierced as she feeds three chicks clustered below. The bird’s yellow-green plumage is shaded with verdigris and highlighted in white. Composition and framing match the upper scene. Text references in the red rubric correspond directly to the illustrated moral chapters. The decorated initials and rubric color echo the border squares, integrating text and image visually."

    "scholarly_interpretation": "This mid-13th-century illuminated bestiary leaf exemplifies the intellectual and devotional aims of monastic scriptoria in northern France. Executed in a refined Gothic textura quadrata, the page integrates two allegorical medallions—an eagle feeding its young and a pelican piercing her breast—each illustrating moral lessons drawn from moralized zoology. The burnished gold grounds and checkerboard border squares reflect Parisian illumination conventions, while the precise underdrawing and layered pigments suggest a highly professional workshop accustomed to producing luxury pedagogical manuscripts. The choice of subjects underscores evolving pedagogical methods: visual exempla reinforcing textual exegesis for sermon preparation. Iconographically, the eagle symbolizes Christ’s resurrection, and the pelican represents sacrificial redemption, tying Old Testament natural history to New Testament salvation themes. The absence of marginal grotesques and the austerity of the margins point to a primarily didactic, rather than purely decorative, function. Comparison with the Rochester Bestiary and the works of the London workshop of Matthew Paris reveals shared compositional devices—circular medallions, alternating border colors—yet the page’s technical sophistication, including gesso relief beneath gold and subtle white highlighting, marks an apex of bestiary production. This leaf thus stands at the intersection of tradition and innovation, marrying conventional moral iconography with advanced material techniques to serve both pedagogical and devotional audiences."
