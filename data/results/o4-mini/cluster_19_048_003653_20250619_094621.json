He wears a green tunic with gold trim and a yellow cloak, the folds rendered with white highlights. Six attendants surround him: two rowers in brown tunics at the stern, a figure adjusting the rudder, two clerics with tonsures rowing amidships, and a standard-bearer at the prow holding a pennon bearing a red cross. The sail, dominated by ultramarine and decorated with six gold heraldic shields bearing red saltire motifs, is furled and tied to the mast at a diagonal. Beneath the boat, stylized green waves overlay a frieze of fish and serpentine creatures in vermillion and brown. To the left, a stylized tree with three tiers of foliage hosts birds and small mammals. All figures face inward, directing attention toward the bishop."

    "scholarly_interpretation": "This luminous miniature, likely produced in a mid-13th-century French atelier, illustrates a bishop journeying by sea, reflecting the era’s fascination with the translation of relics and the mobility of cult objects. Executed with the high-quality ultramarine and burnished gold leaf characteristic of Parisian workshops, the image conveys both devotional intensity and visual splendor. The centralized composition—anchored by the haloed bishop—demonstrates a sophisticated understanding of hierarchical scale, while the dynamic diagonal of the mast and overlapping figures suggest spatial depth without recourse to true linear perspective. Iconographically, the heraldic shields on the sail and the pennon bearing the cross signal ecclesiastical authority and the martial undertones of spiritual conquest. The naturalistic details—the stylized tree with birds and the frieze of marine creatures—situate the narrative in a vivid, if symbolic, environment, linking terrestrial and aquatic realms in service of the saint’s voyage. Compared to contemporaneous manuscripts such as the Psalter of Blanche of Castile, this sheet’s technical refinements—visible underdrawing, gesso-raised gold, and layered color application—underscore a collaborative workshop process and the diffusion of English Channel School influences. As a devotional aid, the scene would have reinforced meditative reading of the accompanying Latin text, blending visual and textual layers to foster a deeper engagement with the saint’s pious example."
