At center and left stand two nearly identical haloed saints in long white albs, each with a blue-lined circular nimbus. The left saint stands in three-quarter view facing right, right hand raised in blessing, left hand lowered; the right saint mirrors the gesture, facing left with right hand uplifted and left hand held at chest. To the right a bearded male figure in a knee-length brown tunic kneels on both knees, head bowed, holding a small smoking censer or vessel from which white smoke curls upward toward the saints. Two stylized trees with green lobed foliage flank the scene—one rising between the left saint and the margin, the other echoing its form beyond the kneeling figure—creating a balanced composition. The figures’ garments are rendered with simple linear folds; the kneeling figure’s tunic shows slight wrap lines. No built architecture appears; the gold ground signifies a sacred space."

    "scholarly_interpretation": "This miniature appears in an administrative register—likely listing the baillis (bailiffs) of a monastic establishment—yet it integrates devotional imagery to underscore the spiritual legitimacy of secular officeholders. Produced in a Gothic workshop around the early fourteenth century, the work reflects the confluence of record-keeping and private devotion characteristic of late medieval monastic culture. The luminous gold background and blue framing suggest Parisian influence, while the schematic modeling of drapery aligns with provincial scriptoria practices. The twin saints, rendered in simplified albs with nimbuses, preside over the kneeling bailiff whose offering of a smoking censer establishes a visual narrative of intercession, reminding administrators that their duties were conducted under divine oversight. Technically, the use of raised gesso, burnished gold, and layered pigments shows a sophisticated material approach; the preservation of the brown-ink underdrawing indicates careful planning. Iconographically, two saints flank a secular officer, visually merging hagiographic and institutional identities; such imagery asserts that monastic governance was a sacred trust. Comparatively, the miniature shares compositional symmetry and gilding techniques with the Parisian Book of Hours tradition, yet its function remains explicitly archival. This blend of administrative and devotional purposes exemplifies late medieval manuscript culture’s integration of practical record-keeping with spiritual reinforcement."
