He wears a red chiton over an ochre undergarment and a shell gold cruciform nimbus. At his feet, in the lower foreground, a single kneeling woman in a brown mantle and white headveil reaches with her right hand to touch the hem of his robe, her body angled three-quarters to the viewer. Behind her, seven apostles stand in a gently curving row extending to the left margin, each haloed and clad in alternating blue, red, green, and yellow tunics with matching mantles; the foremost apostle (Peter) is closest to Christ and glances toward him. The ground is rendered as green mounds decorated with stylized red flowers. The background is divided horizontally: a deep blue sky sprinkled with white dots above a solid green field. All figures are outlined in brown ink with white highlights on drapery, creating a clear visual hierarchy centered on the healing gesture. Secondary decorative features include a red line border and a lower margin floral band of red blossoms and curling green stems."

    "scholarly_interpretation": "This miniature, titled by its rubric as “de muliere fluxu sanguinis patient”, illustrates the Gospel miracle in which a woman healed of her hemorrhage touches the hem of Christ’s garment. Produced in a high-quality European workshop, likely in the mid-13th century, it reflects the period’s emphasis on scriptural exegesis and didactic imagery. The use of Gothic textura quadrata for the rubric and the disciplined pigment palette—azurite blue, vermilion, verdigris, lead white, ochre, and shell gold—indicates an atelier accustomed to both Latin liturgical texts and complementary illumination. The hierarchical composition, with Christ slightly larger than his followers and centrally placed, underscores his divine authority, while the gestural link to the kneeling woman foregrounds the theme of faith. The stylistic parallels—punched gold haloes, fine parallel hatching, and crisp color boundaries—connect this work to the English Channel School, though the precise origin remains uncertain. Iconographically, the scene reinforces Christ’s power over disease and elevates female agency through the woman’s decisive action. Its placement beneath a rubric in a glossed Gospel suggests an educational role: visual reinforcement for monastic readers. Compared to the Psalter of Blanche of Castile, this illumination shows a more restrained border scheme but similar technical sophistication. Overall, it embodies the medieval fusion of text and image, serving theological, educational, and status-display functions within the manuscript."
