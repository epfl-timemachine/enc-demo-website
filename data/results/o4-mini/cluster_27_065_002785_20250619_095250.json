Four hostile elders on the right wear distinctive pointed or crowned hats, carrying spears and a round shield decorated with concentric circles. Their garments include a minium-red tunic with blue cloak, green cote with red edging, and a patterned blue-green skirt. To the left, three men lie prostrate: one fallen face-down, head turned three-quarters right, clad in a blue tunic over a red undergarment; another on his back in a green tunic; the third beneath in a purple robe. The attackers lean forward, spears poised. The background is burnished gold. Figures are outlined in brown ink, with flat color fills and white lead highlights in drapery folds. Spatially, the standing group overlaps the victims to suggest depth. The border of this scene is a red rule, above and below a continuous gold field, framed by the blue-and-red vine scroll margin."

    "scholarly_interpretation": "This four-scene illumination of Saint Stephen’s life likely originates in a mid-13th-century French workshop, reflecting the high Gothic taste for narrative cycles in Books of Hours or private glossed Legends. The use of burnished gold backgrounds and richly cadenced red-and-blue garments aligns with Parisian illumination practices under Louis IX’s influence, where devotional manuscripts served both liturgical and lay uses. The execution suggests multiple hands: a skilled master laid in underdrawing and gold groundwork, while color application and white stippling reveal an assistant’s brush, indicative of a collaborative atelier. Iconographically, Stephen’s debate, sermon, vision, and martyrdom form a typological sequence linking Old Testament prototypes of prophetic witness to Christological vindication. The sheep-like crowd’s gestural engagement and the martial accoutrements of his persecutors underscore the conflict between earthly and heavenly authority. Comparatively, the cycle shares compositional devices with the Psalter of Blanche of Castile (BnF, Latin 115), notably alternating color palettes and vine borders. Yet it innovates by compressing four narrative moments into a two-register format, maximizing devotional impact within limited folio space. Technically, the layered pigment work, gesso relief, and precise punchwork reflect advanced material know-how in gothic manuscript illumination, merging tradition with inventive spatial economy."
