Six figures occupy the deck: at stern a helmsman in green tunic grips the tiller; centrally a merchant in a long blue robe and pointed felt hat stands holding a small purse at his waist; two sailors in red and vermilion tunics brace at the mast base, one with arms raised grasping the halyard; a third crewman in a short green cote leans forward to secure a rope; a final figure in russet hose stands just behind the merchant observing. The wooden hull is rendered with black-and-white diagonal striping; the sail is furled and decorated with a small gold boss at the masthead. Above the scene runs a single line caption in brown ink Gothic script. The sky is blank parchment. Spatially, the boat is oriented diagonally from lower left to upper right, creating forward motion. The figures overlap to suggest depth. Clothing details include visible seam lines on the merchant’s robe, hose with stitch delineation, and creased cuffs. The mast shows rigging rings and a furled pennon. This panel establishes the central action of departure and frames the narrative of the merchant’s voyage."

    "scholarly_interpretation": "This six-paneled leaf, likely produced in a late 13th–early 14th-century Iberian workshop, illustrates a merchant’s sea voyage, commercial transaction, and culminating donation to the Virgin Mary. The grid format and continuous floral-quatrefoil border reflect a mature narrative convention, placing equal visual weight on each episode. The use of ultramarine—a costly pigment—on the merchant’s robes and the burnished gold leaf in architectural details signal the patron’s wealth and the manuscript’s high status. Technically, the application of gesso under gold and the crisp quill underdrawing reveal a professional atelier practice. The depiction of Gothic micro-architecture in the interior and final panels suggests familiarity with contemporary Catalan cathedral structures. Iconographically, the sequence links secular enterprise with devotional charity, using the journey as metaphor for spiritual pilgrimage. The alternation of maritime and clerical scenes emphasizes the interdependence of commerce and piety in medieval urban culture. Compared to other Iberian narrative cycles of the period, such as the Valencia Trades Book, this leaf shares a similar handling of wave motifs and costume details but innovates through its integration of interior notarial activity. The manuscript thus occupies a transitional moment in Spanish illumination, blending traditional border ornament with a more complex multi-scene grid, anticipating the 14th-century Catalan workshop’s narrative sophistication."
