At left stands Christ with a cruciform halo, facing right, his right hand raised in benediction, left hand holding a rectangular sacred container. He wears a full-length monastic cloak with visible hood, draped in naturalistic folds. Center foreground, a man kneels with torso inclined back, head thrown upward, mouth agape; he is clad in a belted knee-length tunic and hose with pointed shoes. Perched upon his shoulders and scalp is a small demon, naked, with bat-like wings and pointed tail, gripping a rod aimed at the man’s head. Behind the kneeling man stand two attendants in tunics: one grasps the possessed man’s arm, the other observes with folded hands. Facial expressions convey anguish and authority. Relative scales: Christ slightly larger, emphasizing spiritual power. Depth is suggested by overlapping limbs and attenuated shading. Clothing textures vary: Christ’s wool cloak shows heavy drapery, commoners’ tunics appear lighter, with linear fold shading. No architectural backdrop ensures focus on the miracle."

    "scholarly_interpretation": "Produced in a mid-14th-century Northern French scriptorium, this folio exemplifies the integration of narrative illustration and text in Gospel manuscripts. The precise Gothic textura quadrata script, punctuated by red rubrics, indicates a high-status commission, likely for cathedral use. The exorcism scene conforms to the era’s preference for didactic imagery: Christ’s authoritative gesture and the demon’s aggressive posture dramatize the power of divine word. The restrained palette—azurite blue initials, vermillion filigree, and gray tonal washes—reflects both the workshop’s access to quality pigments and a conscious restraint that highlights the sacred narrative. Technical innovations include raised gesso under the purple ground of the winged ox medallion and visible underdrawing, suggesting a multi-stage process common in Parisian ateliers. Iconographically, the small devil emphasizes the text’s spiritual battle, while the evangelist’s symbol anchors the scene within Luke’s Gospel. Comparative analysis with the Psalter of Blanche of Castile reveals similar pen-flourished initials and figural proportions, arguing for shared stylistic influences across royal and ecclesiastical commissions. This folio thus bridges traditional iconographic programs with evolving devotional practices emphasizing personal engagement with Gospel miracles."
