      "scene_description": "The folio’s narrative is articulated in two horizontal registers. In the lower register, four fishermen in coarse tunics and red caps strain at a heavy, netted haul in two small wooden boats afloat on a dark green, undulating moat. The boats are drawn in profile, the net arching upward, bursting with silvery fish whose scales catch white highlights. Above, a fortified pink stone castle with twin cylindrical towers and blue-roofed turrets dominates the upper register. Within its colonnaded ground floor, a group of laypeople in white head coverings and simple tunics line up behind a bishop wearing a deep ultramarine cloak and carrying a gold-lustred crozier. He gestures benevolently toward the crowd while two clerics at right, framed by traceried windows, hand down baskets of fish. Figures are hierarchically scaled: the bishop and towers loom larger, underlining his divine authority. Costume details include visible weave patterns on the fishermen’s hose and a rich gold-embroidered mitre. Architectural details – cusped arches, diapered walls, punch-work on battlements – combine with the patterned background and vine-scroll marginalia to focus the eye on the miracle’s central act of charity."

    "scholarly_interpretation": "This full-page miniature, likely produced in a northern French workshop c. 1325–1335, exemplifies the flourishing Gothic tradition of narrative illumination in hagiographic manuscripts. The dual-register structure, framed by architectural pinnacles and gilt vine scrolls, reflects the era’s interest in spatial segmentation for sequential storytelling. The bold use of ultramarine and gold leaf underscores the miracle’s sanctity, while vermilion and ochre lend warmth to the narrative drama. Under UV examination, the confident underdrawing and careful layering of pigments reveal a multi-hand collaboration typical of court-sponsored ateliers. Iconographically, the scene depicts the legendary ‘Miracle of the Fishes’ performed by a bishop-saint, emphasizing ecclesiastical charity and communal salvation. The hierarchical scaling of the bishop above the common fishermen reinforces clerical authority and divinely sanctioned social order. Comparatively, the diapered backgrounds and micro-architectural framing align this folio with the Tours School’s ornate style, yet the naturalistic gestures and netted volume suggest influence from continental workshops in Paris. The manuscript thus occupies a liminal space between English Channel School decorative richness and early Parisian expressiveness. Its technical sophistication—gesso relief, punch work, and layered white highlights—signals innovations in material application that would inform later Book of Hours production. Overall, this illumination embodies both the continuity of established iconographic programs and the dynamic experimentation of early 14th-century Gothic illumination."
