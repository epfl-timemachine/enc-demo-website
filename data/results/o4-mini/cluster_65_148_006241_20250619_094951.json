      "scene_description": "A single cohesive scene depicts a bearded saint with halo and an accompanying haloed angel on the left third of the panel, standing barefoot on a narrow green ground line. The saint, clad in orange-red tunic with green-lined cloak, raises both hands in an orant gesture, while the angel in blue and gold-striped robe extends a guiding hand toward the right. On the right two-thirds, five grotesque demons—rendered in shades of gray, blue, and pink with animalistic heads and spindly limbs—assault a central nude male figure stripped to pale white flesh. One demon crouches atop the victim’s shoulders, another claws his hair, a third bites his thigh, a fourth pulls his foot, and the fifth brandishes a green staff. The tormented man’s mouth gapes, eyes wide in anguish. Spatially, the saint and angel are scaled slightly larger, framing the drama; overlapping demons create a clustered depth. Costumes: saint’s cloak shows woven cloth-of-gold effect; angel’s robe displays wooden folds; demons lack clothing, their exaggerated anatomy signifying spiritual corruption. The simplicity of background emphasizes psychological tension between holy guidance and infernal violence."

    "scholarly_interpretation": "This illumination, likely produced in a mid-13th-century Parisian workshop, illustrates a popular hagiographic subject: the torment of a soul by devils under the protective auspices of a saint and angel. The use of ultramarine and vermillion suggests access to expensive pigments, indicating a commission by a wealthy patron, perhaps for a book of hours intended for private devotion. The diapered red ground with gold tooling reflects the Gothic penchant for decorative patterning, while the hierarchical scaling of holy figures versus demons underscores theological distinctions between divine authority and infernal chaos. The fluid line work and minimal hatching point to a transitional style influenced by the early Gothic naturalism of the Île-de-France, yet retain abstractions in demon anatomy that echo English Channel School grotesques. Iconographically, the scene emphasizes the saint’s intercessory power: the angel’s guiding gesture and the saint’s orant posture provide a didactic model for the viewer’s own reliance on heavenly protection against temptation. Comparatively, this image shares stylistic affinities with the Psalter of Blanche of Castile in its color palette and patterning, but departs through its concentrated narrative focus rather than extensive marginalia. The integration of intense emotional expression with decorative form exemplifies the period’s innovative blending of personal devotional affect with established iconographic tradition."
