Five stand in a semi-circle: all wear red tunics—three with matching chaperons and two with hoods in natural brown—and point toward the tree. Their garments feature simple trims and buttoned fronts; two wear patterned hose and pointed poulaines. In the lower left, a seated scribe in a white and red patterned robe holds an unfurled parchment scroll inscribed with Latin text. He gazes upward toward the speakers. Two tall, slender trees frame the group in the background. The ground is sparsely indicated by tufts of olive-green grass. On the right page, two vertical columns of schematic trees—three on the left column and four on the right—are depicted against a ruled backdrop, each tree marked by red foliage patterns and paired with grass tufts, suggesting stages of grafting or growth. The composition is flat, with all figures and diagrams sharing a common baseline and rendered without cast shadows."

    "scholarly_interpretation": "This mid-15th-century agricultural codex, likely produced in a professional workshop, reflects the period’s emphasis on practical estate management. Crafted on fine calf vellum, the folio combines a didactic figural scene with schematic diagrams to teach tree grafting or cultivation. The use of vermilion red for both garments and foliage patterns, set against sparse green and brown, underscores key instructional elements. The Gothic cursive script, with its quill-ruling and abbreviations, indicates a text intended for regular consultation rather than ceremonial display. Iconographically, the central tree serves as the pedagogical focal point, surrounded by expert advisers and a dedicated scribe, embodying authorial authority. The repetition of stylized trees in vertical columns on the facing page maps a sequential process, linking visual theory with practice. Technically, the flat spatial treatment and uniform line work align with late medieval schematic illustration conventions, while the stability of pigments suggests high-quality workshop materials. Comparatively, this manuscript shares affinities with other late medieval agricultural treatises that balance figural narrative with diagrammatic clarity, such as the Tacuinum Sanitatis tradition adapted for rural concerns. The integration of a dignified teaching scene with precise botanical schemata represents an innovative fusion of courtly manuscript illumination techniques with vernacular practical knowledge, signaling the growing importance of specialized manuals in late medieval Europe."
