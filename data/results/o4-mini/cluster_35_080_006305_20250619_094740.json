Four figures occupy the square frame: at left, David sits on a bench wearing a long red tunic with wide sleeves, his right hand raised in a gesture of acceptance and his left hand resting on his knee. Behind him stands a court attendant in a beige gown, hands clasped. To the right, Samuel is portrayed in red and white liturgical vestments under a mitre, his right hand raised in blessing and his left holding a small ampulla of oil. Behind Samuel is a second cleric holding an open book with red rubrication. The deep ultramarine background is patterned with gold diapering. Spatially, the figures form a shallow horizontal band, each scaled to denote narrative importance rather than naturalistic depth. David’s robe shows white lead highlights along folds, and Samuel’s vestments are delineated with fine pen hatching. The attendant’s simpler garb contrasts with the prophet’s ornate dress, indicating differing social and religious roles. The bench, oil vessel, and book function as ritual props, while the diapered ground and foliate penwork anchor the scene within the initial letter."

    "scholarly_interpretation": "This historiated initial, likely executed in a mid-13th-century Parisian workshop, illustrates the anointing of David by the prophet Samuel from 1 Samuel 16:13, a scene commonly placed at the opening of psalms to underscore Davidic authorship. The high-quality materials—ultramarine and burnished gold—signal a noble patron’s commission for private devotional use. The Gothic textura quadrata hand reflects a professional scriptorium setting, while the refined quill-pen linework and layered pigments denote a master illuminator’s touch. Iconographically, Samuel’s episcopal vestments and ampulla of oil underscore divine election and sacral kingship, aligning scriptural precedent with late Capetian political assertions of royal authority. Decorative punchwork and diapered grounds recall the Psalter of Blanche of Castile (BNF Latin 115), suggesting shared workshop practices of raised gesso backgrounds and micro-architectural framing. Technically, underdrawing corrections visible under UV light point to a collaborative production model: a master draftsman establishing composition, followed by colorists layering pigments and gold. The composition’s centralized format and hierarchical scaling prioritize theological meaning over spatial realism, marking a transitional moment in Parisian illumination where traditional biblical iconography was reimagined to serve both personal piety and political ideology. Its excellent preservation affords insight into medieval book production, liturgical visual culture, and the interplay of art, devotion, and dynastic propaganda."
